# ðŸ“± COVID Pass Data Harvester

The UK COVID Status Check app is missing a feature - the ability to store the personal data contained in the QR code for a later date. This application provides establishments across the UK with an incredibly easy-to-use interface for viewing and exporting, en masse, personal QR code data such as:

* Name
* Date of birth
* Number of doses
* Type of vaccine (e.g. Pfizer, Moderna, AZ etc.)
* Vaccine issued by (e.g. NHS Scotland)

<!--This app has been tested with the NHS Scotland COVID Pass Verifier and NHS Scotland COVID Status apps.-->
