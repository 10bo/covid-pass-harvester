# ðŸ“± COVID Pass Data Harvester

The UK COVID Status Check app is missing a feature - the ability to store the personal data contained in the QR code for a later date. This application provides establishments across the UK with an incredibly easy-to-use interface for viewing and exporting, en masse, personal QR code data such as:

* Name
* Date of birth
* Number of vaccine doses
* Type of vaccine (e.g. Pfizer, Moderna, AZ etc.)
* Vaccine issuer (e.g. NHS Scotland)
* COVID positivity status (not currently in use in the UK).

<!--This app has been tested with the NHS Scotland COVID Pass Verifier and NHS Scotland COVID Status apps.-->

## Reasons to gather QR Data

The QR data often contains personal information on consumers. This information can be:

* **Sold to third parties** for advertisement purposes.
* **Combined with other data** to improve the data stored in an establishment's database by adding data previously not stored (e.g. if an establishment runs a Guestlist entry service or online mailing list, it will now be possible to add date of birth, vaccine, and COVID positivity status data).
* **Stored more centrally** and combined with data from organisations (run by the same legal entity or otherwise) to enforce a two-tier society.


## How to run

This app is in early development. Basic QR data can be read - here are the steps:

1. Place a COVID status QR code into the `src/example-files/` directory.
1. Run `npm i` in the `src/` directory.
1. Run `node src/index.js` in the project root.

The output will be logged to the console.
